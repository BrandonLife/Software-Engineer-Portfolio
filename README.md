<li>Reactjs</li>
<li>NodeJs</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>ExpressJs</li>
</ul>

<h1>CSS Frameworks used</h1>
<ul>

</ul>

<h1>Problems I encountered while making this project</h1>
<ol>
<li>Struggling to get the backend working</li>
<p>I tried initally to create a backend with vanilla javascript as we had done in school. For some reason this was not working for me so i went to youtube to look for a solution.</p>
<p>Solution can be found at -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xElA9mGi-I0</p>
<li>So an issue i  had was using react bootstrap cards to properly display on the screen. When i would create a card, the image, the title, and the summary would not display but dummy data showed that the cards were showing but somewhere there was an issue. Still Currently working on this.  </li>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
